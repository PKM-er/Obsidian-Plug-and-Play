## 1. 引用语法

要创建块引用，请在段落前添加一个 `>` 符号。

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

渲染效果如下：

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### 1.1. 多个段落的块引用

块引用可以包含多个段落。为段落之间的空白行添加一个 `>` 符号。

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

渲染效果如下：

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
> 
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### 1.2. 嵌套块引用

块引用可以嵌套。在要嵌套的段落前添加一个 `>>` 符号。

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

渲染效果如下：

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
> 
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### 1.3. 带有其它元素的块引用

块引用可以包含其他 Markdown 格式的元素。并非所有元素都可以使用，你需要进行实验以查看哪些元素有效。

```
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

渲染效果如下：

> #### [](https://github.com/DarkoCat/Obsidian-Vault/blob/main/Obsidian%20Vault/%3D%3D%3DObsidian%26Markdown%3D%3D%3D/Markdown.md#the-quarterly-results-look-great)The quarterly results look great!
> 
> -   Revenue was off the chart.
> -   Profits were higher than ever.
> 
> _Everything_ is going according to **plan**.
